Soldering Station Analog
========================

WTF is this?
------------
A D.I.Y. cheap temperature-regulated soldering station powered from a laptop adaptor. 
It is developed in a http://hspbp.org[hungarian hackerspace]. It can be 
purchased as a D.I.Y. kit also, see the details http://hspbp.org/ironkit[here]. 
This is an open-source project. The printed circuit board and other informations 
are published https://github.com/mrtee/soldering-station-analog[here]. The project 
has a unique link:soldering-station-analog/blob/master/LICENSE.asciidoc[license]. 

Build notes
-----------
In order to build this equipment you need to make the PCB, get some components, 
a laptop adaptor 19-24V, the professional iron "IRON-N" for 6.5 EUR and solder the box.

Drilling
~~~~~~~~
The holes are 0.8 mm except the
- DIN-5 connector, the ground connection (derives from the central pin of the DIN-5 
connector), the transistor -- these holes should be 1 mm
- The big potentiometer's holes should be 1.2 mm
- The other holes at the edges should be 3 mm and the big one 6.5 mm
- The holes on the plastic box should be 6.5 mm

Component list
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are 3 versions of the equipment: the boxed version with RETRO
and ELECTRO styles, and the BOXLESS version which is cheap.
